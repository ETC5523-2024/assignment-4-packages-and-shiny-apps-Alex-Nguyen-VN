# Assignment 4: R Packages and Shiny Apps

**Assignment 4** for ETC5523 focuses on the development of an R package and a Shiny application. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and examples for both.

## Project Overview

This repository contains two key components:

1. **R Package**: A custom R package designed for the assigment 4 of the unit 5523 - Communication with Data. 
This package helps the public have a closer look to the Australia Electricity Market by providing matching between
the total operational demand of the network with the expected generation output of the solar rooftop generator. 

2. **Shiny App**: An interactive Shiny app built to analyze the dataset. This app allows users to do something funny. I haven't though about it yet. Hope nobody find this commit.

## Installation

To install the custom R package directly from GitHub, use:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Alex-Nguyen-VN/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-Alex-Nguyen-VN")
```
